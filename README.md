<h1 align="center">Luna Programming Language</h1>
<h3 align="center">
Visual and textual functional programming language with a focus on productivity, collaboration and development ergonomics.
</h3>

Luna is a developerâ€™s whiteboard on steroids. Design, prototype, develop and
refactor any application simply by connecting visual elements together.
Collaborate with co-workers, interactively fine tune parameters, inspect the
results and visually profile the performance in real-time.

Visit [The Luna Website](http://www.luna-lang.org) to learn more!

This repository contains the Luna compiler core and its command line version.
For the full (visual) Luna Studio, please take a look at the
[Luna Studio](https://github.com/luna/luna-studio) repository. For installation
and management tools, there is [Luna Manager](https://github.com/luna/luna-manager).

## Getting Started
This will get you up and running for Luna development, with only a minimal
amount of setup required. Luna's build system is nice and simple, allowing you 
to bootstrap the compiler as long as you have an installation of 
[The Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

### System Requirements
Luna runs on all reasonably new Linuxes, MacOS, and Windows. Luna was mostly
tested on Ubuntu >= 14.04, Fedora >= 23, MacOS >= 10.11 (El Capitan) and Windows
10, although it should run fine on all Linux distros like Mint, Debian or Arch.
Please report any issues here on GitHub or shoot an email to
[contact@luna-lang.org](mailto:contact@luna-lang.org).

### Getting the Sources
Given you've probably been reading this document on GitHub, you might have an
inkling where to look!. You can clone Luna using two methods:

- **Via HTTPS:** We recommend you only use HTTPS if checking out the sources as
  read-only.

```
git clone https://github.com/luna/luna.git
```

- **Via SSH:** For those who plan on regularly making direct commits, cloning
  over SSH may provide a better user experience (but requires setting up your
  SSH Keys with GitHub).

```
git clone git@github.com:luna/luna.git
```

### Building Luna
To build the command-line compiler interface along with all its sub-components,
you will need to build the `shell` project. The instructions below assume that
your `luna` repo is already cloned and we will refer to its location as
`$LUNA_REPO_PATH`.

```
cd $LUNA_REPO_PATH
stack install
```

Note that the executable for the compiler will be located in
`$LUNA_REPO_PATH/dist/bin/public/luna` folder. You may wish to add it to your
`$PATH`.

Additionally, if you intend to simply use the Luna compiler (as opposed to
tinkering with it, which requires frequent rebuilds), you may consider adding
`--ghc-options="-O2 -j4"` to the stack install command. This should make the
Luna compiler run considerably faster, at the cost of longer build times for
building it.

#### Building Luna Components
It is also possible to build and test each component of Luna (e.g. core, parser)
separately. To do this, pick the component you want from the following list, and
then execute the following command:

```
stack build <component>
stack test <component>
```

Where `<component>` is one of the following:

- `luna-core` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/core`)
- `lune-passes` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/passes`)
- `luna-package` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/package`)
- `luna-runtime` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/runtime`)
- `luna-shell` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/shell`)
- `luna-stdlib` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/stdlib`)
- `luna-syntax-text-lexer` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/syntax/text/lexer`)
- `luna-syntax-text-parser` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/syntax/text/parser`)

#### Developing Luna's Libraries
Currently, all of the libraries owned by us that Luna depends on are in-tree,
and can be found in the 'libs' folder. This is motivated by how often were 
were changing them purely to support Luna's development, and then having to go
through the hackage release song and dance. 

Instead, while these libraries are so actively developed. we've decided that
they should live in Luna's tree, where they can be depended on by Luna and
Luna Studio directly. 

Working with these libraries is a breeze. If you want to make some changes, it's
as simple as making them, and rebuilding to test them. 

#### Building Luna for Release
In order to keep compile times down for development, we compile Luna with 
`-fomit-interface-pragmas`. However, this disables cross-module inlining, which
is an important optimisation for Luna's performance. 

In order to build Luna for maximum performance, you need to override this flag
when giving the build command. This can be done as follows:

```
stack build --ghc-options="-fno-omit-interface-pragmas" <...>
```

It is recommended to always use this when building the benchmarks. You can use
this additional argument with any of the commands listed above for development
of individual components.

### Running Luna
First, you need to create the project. This is as simple as executing
`luna init <project-path>`, which will create a project in the directory
specified with the correct structure. It will create a defaulted `Main.luna`
file for you as well, allowing you to immediately execute this.

To interpret and run the project, simply type `luna run` in the main project
directory. Alternatively, you can pass the project directory explicitly as
follows:

```
luna run --target path/to/MyProject
```

#### Executing Luna on Standalone Files
The Luna interpreter is also capable of executing standalone Luna files. This
can be done by passing a luna source file to the `--target` flag, similarly to
the above.

#### Overriding the Standard Library Location
By default, a development build of Luna will look for the standard library in
`$LUNA_REPO_PATH/stdlib/`, but it is possible to override this. If you would 
like to do so, you need to define the `LUNA_STDLIB_OVERRIDE` environment 
variable and set its value to the absolute path to the Luna standard library 
that you want to use. 

As long as the variable is set, the compiler will use the location you provide,
so don't forget to unset it if you would like to go back to using the included
copy. 

This environment variable override will also work for distributed binaries of
Luna, and so provides a useful way to work on the standard library without 
needing to download and build Luna in its entirety.
